function binaryImage = Lasso_fnc(Cropped_im)
% Semi-automatic detection of the aggregates on TEM images
% Function to be used with the Pair Correlation Method (PCM) package
% Ramin Dastanpour & Steven N. Rogak
% Developed at the University of British Columbia
% This function allows user to draw an approximate boundary around the
% particle. Region of interest (ROI))

% Updated by Yiling Kang on May. 10, 2018
% Updates/QOL Changes:
%   - Asks user if their lasso selection is correct before applying the
%     data
%   - QOL - User will not have to restart program if they mess up the lasso
