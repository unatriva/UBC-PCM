# UBC-PCM

UBC's Pair Correlation Method MatLab code for processing TEM images of soot to determine morphological properties based on work published in Powder Technology (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.027). 

This is an archived version of the Unviersity of British Columbia's TEM analysis code and is now deprecated. An updated codebase with significant improvements to efficiency, code readability, and a much larger range of capabilities is available at https://github.com/tsipkens/atems. Of note, the new codebase features an updated aggregate segmenter using *k*-means, following work published in the Journal of Aerosol Science (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105699). Code for the pair correlation method (PCM), for which this code is named, is available in the updated repository [here](https://github.com/tsipkens/atems/blob/master/%2Bpp/pcm.m).
